    <p>
        Please now imagine the following situation: You can choose between drawing a ball from two different urns, urn A
        and urn B. Urn A contains {{ Constants.num_balls }} balls, some are white and some are black. However, you donâ€™t
        know how many balls are white and how many balls are black. Any combination is possible. There might be from 0
        to {{ Constants.num_balls }} white balls, with the remaining balls being black. Put differently, you do not know
        the probability of drawing a white or a black ball. Urn B contains {{ Constants.num_balls }} balls as well, but
        you know the exact number of white and black balls in this urn. In other words, you know the exact probability
        of drawing a white or a black ball. Now choose a color, either white or black. Suppose you
        win {{ Constants.prize|cu }} if you draw a ball of the color you have selected. If the ball is of the other
        color, you win nothing.
